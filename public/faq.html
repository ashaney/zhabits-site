    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2>Why another habit tracker?</h2>
    <p>We set out to build a web-based habit tracker that was simple to use, yet powerful and flexible. We believe that the best habit trackers are the ones that are easy to understand, while still being capable of handling the complexities of real life. Other habit trackers are great, but we aim to offer a unique balance of simplicity and functionality.</p>

    <h2>Will there be a mobile app?</h2>
    <p>No, we do not have plans to build a mobile app at this time. However, you can add https://zhabits.app to your home screen to use it as a PWA (Progressive Web App), which provides a similar experience to a native app.</p>

    <h2>Are you working on feature [x]?</h2>
    <p>Please check out our <a href="/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> to see what we are currently working on. If you don't see what you need, please let us know!</p>


    <h2>Are you affiliated with James Clear?</h2>
    <p>No, this is an independent app built off of the principles of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299">Atomic Habits</a> by <a href="https://jamesclear.com/">James Clear.</a> We are not affiliated with him or his company.</p>
